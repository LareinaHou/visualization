# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
Good one: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/us.census.bureau/viz/Apportionment_16116063135030/Apportionment
Bad one: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maryia.maziuk/viz/MissionstoMars/MissionstoMars

Comprehensive recongnition of the Historical Apportionment Data Map Visualization:
1.Creditable Data Represented
    Accuracy of historical data representation from the goverment database
    Clear depiction of apportionment changes over time
    Precision in geographical boundaries

2.Contextual Information
    Clear legend explaining color/shading meanings
    Temporal context (specific years or periods represented)

3.Color Scheme Effectiveness with purposeful color palette
    Use sequential color gradients to show population changes
    Blue-to-red scale for population shifts
    Consistent color logic across different time periods
    Ensure color-blind friendly design


Comprehensive Critique of the Missions to Mars Visualization:
1.Data Source Integrity by using Wikipedia as a source
    Open editing model allows unrestricted modifications
    Lacks rigorous academic peer review
    Potential for introducing unverified or biased information
    Compromises the fundamental reliability of the data presentation

2.Design and Visual Communication Failures
    Cluttered and unorganized layout
    Inconsistent and non-purposeful color scheme
    Colors do not enhance data comprehension or highlight key comparisons
    Visual elements distract from data rather than illuminate it

3.Labeling and Contextual Deficiencies
    Requires user interaction (clicking dots) to understand context
    Breaks fundamental principles of immediate data comprehension
    Creates unnecessary cognitive load for the reader

4.Cognitive Accessibility
    Complex interaction model prevents quick information absorption
    User must take extra steps to understand basic information
    Violates principles of clear, immediate data communication







      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
1. Data Source Credibility
The visualization's reliance on Wikipedia undermines its scientific integrity. By sourcing data from peer-reviewed NASA reports, scientific journals, and official space agency archives, we could transform the visualization from a potentially unreliable collection of facts to a robust, trustworthy representation of humanity's Mars exploration journey.

2. Design Complexity
A well-designed visualization should tell a story at a glance, guiding the viewer's eye through the progression of technological achievements and scientific milestones. By simplifying the layout, using clean lines, and creating a logical flow, we can make the complex history of Mars exploration more accessible and engaging. An effective design would use color purposefully â€“ perhaps cool blues and oranges to represent different mission types or technological eras. 

3. Labeling and Contextual Information
The most significant flaw is the requirement for users to interact (clicking dots) to understand basic information. A superior visualization provides immediate context. Clear, concise labels, strategically placed annotations, and a comprehensive legend can communicate complex mission details without requiring additional user interaction.

Practical Recommendations:
    Use authoritative, peer-reviewed data sources
    Implement a clean, purpose-driven design
    Create color schemes that communicate, not just decorate
    Provide immediate, comprehensive context
    Design with user comprehension as the primary goal
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
